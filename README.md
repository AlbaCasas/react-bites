## About The Project

![ReactBites Home][product-screenshot]

ReactBites was originally started as a simple repository of exercises to practice my react skills.

I hope other react students out there can use it to find inspiration of challenges that will help them learn the technology.

### Built With

- SASS / itcss
- ReactJS
